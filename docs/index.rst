Welcome to Github Labelbot's documentation!
===========================================

Github Labelbot is a simple GitHub bot written in Python3 allowing automatic
labeling of GitHub issues. It can run in two different modes - as simple
console application periodically checking the issues in given interval, or as
a webapp allowing usage of `GitHub Webhooks`_. For further details on how to use
Github Labelbot, please see :ref:`running`. For source code details, refer to
:ref:`source-documentation`.
